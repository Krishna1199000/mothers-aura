# Cloudinary Setup Guide

## ✅ **Image Upload is Now Fixed!**

The image upload functionality has been updated to use **server-side uploads** which are more reliable and secure.

## 🔧 **How It Works Now:**

1. **Server-Side Upload**: Images are uploaded through our API endpoint (`/api/upload/image`)
2. **Automatic Processing**: Cloudinary automatically optimizes images
3. **Secure**: Admin-only uploads with proper authentication
4. **Reliable**: No need for upload presets or complex configuration

## 📋 **Current Configuration:**

```
Cloud Name: dxiccp9b8
API Key: 861389368398686
API Secret: rqRlmI2iXKOZUjF3tHYM5Svor3o
```

## 🚀 **Features:**

- ✅ **Automatic Image Optimization**: Resized to 800x600px max
- ✅ **Quality Auto**: Best quality/size balance
- ✅ **Format Auto**: WebP when supported, fallback to original
- ✅ **Folder Organization**: Images stored in `notifications/` folder
- ✅ **Admin Security**: Only admins can upload images
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and validation

## 🧪 **Testing:**

1. Go to admin panel
2. Click the notification bell
3. Create a new notification
4. Upload an image (drag & drop or click to browse)
5. Image will be automatically optimized and uploaded
6. Verify it appears in the notification

## 🔒 **Security Features:**

- **Authentication Required**: Only logged-in admins can upload
- **Server-Side Processing**: Uploads go through our secure API
- **File Validation**: Type and size validation on both client and server
- **Optimized Storage**: Images are automatically compressed and optimized

## 📊 **Image Processing:**

All uploaded images are automatically:
- Resized to fit within 800x600 pixels
- Optimized for web delivery
- Converted to WebP when possible
- Stored in Cloudinary's global CDN
- Organized in the `notifications/` folder

## 🛠️ **No Additional Setup Required!**

The system is now fully functional with server-side uploads. No need to:
- Create upload presets
- Configure unsigned uploads
- Set up complex Cloudinary settings

Just upload and it works! 🎉
